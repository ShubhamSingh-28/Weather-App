Build a SaaS web app called EVa that allows small businesses and solopreneurs to create a custom voice assistant for their website.

The app must include:

1. A business owner onboarding form where the owner enters:
- Business name
- About description
- Brand values
- Contact method (email or WhatsApp)
- Booking link
- Preferred voice tone (professional, friendly, calm, energetic)

2. A services manager where the owner can add:
- Service name
- Service description
- Optional price

3. A basic dashboard where the owner can view:
- Their business profile
- Their list of services
- Captured leads
- Recent conversations

Do NOT include payments, multi-language, advanced analytics, or team features.

This is version 1 MVP only.
